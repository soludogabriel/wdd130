          Hello, I'm Soludo Gabriel, an 18-year-old residing in the vibrant city
          of Abuja, Nigeria. At the intersection of technology and leisure, I've
          crafted a world that revolves around my two greatest passions –
          computers and games. Nestled in Abuja, I embark on a journey of
          exploration into the expansive realms of technology. From delving into
          the intricacies of programming languages to immersing myself in the
          ever-evolving landscape of digital innovation, every day brings new
          discoveries and challenges that fuel my enthusiasm for all things tech.
          Simultaneously, my love affair with the exciting world of gaming knows
          no bounds. I find joy in navigating virtual landscapes, uncovering
          compelling narratives, and mastering the art of strategy in diverse
          gaming genres. Whether it's the adrenaline rush of competitive gaming or
          the immersive storytelling of single-player adventures, the world of
          gaming provides me with a dynamic canvas for self-expression and
          entertainment. Living in Abuja, a city brimming with cultural richness
          and technological opportunities, I've cultivated a perfect balance
          between my fascination with digital innovation and my appreciation for
          leisure activities. As an 18-year-old enthusiast, I eagerly anticipate
          the endless possibilities that await in the ever-evolving realms of
          computers and games.

        <p>
          Nigeria is a multinational state inhabited by more than 250 ethnic
          groups speaking 500 distinct languages, all identifying with a wide
          variety of cultures. The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa in
          the north, Yoruba in the west, and Igbo in the east, together
          constituting over 60% of the total population. The official language is
          English, chosen to facilitate linguistic unity at the national levloel.
          Nigeria's constitution ensures de jure freedom of religion and it is
          home to some of the world's largest Muslim and Christian populations.
          Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Muslims, who live mostly in
          the north, and Christians, who live mostly in the south; indigenous
          religions, such as those native to the Igbo and Yoruba ethnicities, are
          in the minority. Nigeria is a regional power in Africa and a middle
          power in international affairs. Nigeria's economy is the largest in
          Africa, the 39th-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and 27th-largest
          by PPP. Nigeria is often referred to as the Giant of Africa owing to its
          large population and economy and is considered to be an emerging market
          by the World Bank. Nigeria is a founding member of the African Union and
          a member of many international organizations, including the United
          Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, NAM, the Economic Community of
          West African States, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and OPEC. It is
          also a member of the informal MINT group of countries and is one of the
          Next Eleven economies.
