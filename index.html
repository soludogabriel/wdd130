        Hello, I'm Soludo Gabriel, an 18-year-old from Abuja, Nigeria. My world
        revolves around computers and games, two passions that I hold dear.
        Living in Abuja, I find joy in exploring the realms of technology and
        immersing myself in the exciting world of gaming. It's a perfect balance
        between my fascination with digital innovation and my love for leisure
        activities.

        Nigeria is a multinational state inhabited by more than 250 ethnic
        groups speaking 500 distinct languages, all identifying with a wide
        variety of cultures. The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa in
        the north, Yoruba in the west, and Igbo in the east, together
        constituting over 60% of the total population. The official language is
        English, chosen to facilitate linguistic unity at the national levloel.
        Nigeria's constitution ensures de jure freedom of religion and it is
        home to some of the world's largest Muslim and Christian populations.
        Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Muslims, who live mostly in
        the north, and Christians, who live mostly in the south; indigenous
        religions, such as those native to the Igbo and Yoruba ethnicities, are
        in the minority. Nigeria is a regional power in Africa and a middle
        power in international affairs. Nigeria's economy is the largest in
        Africa, the 39th-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and 27th-largest
        by PPP. Nigeria is often referred to as the Giant of Africa owing to its
        large population and economy and is considered to be an emerging market
        by the World Bank. Nigeria is a founding member of the African Union and
        a member of many international organizations, including the United
        Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, NAM, the Economic Community of
        West African States, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and OPEC. It is
        also a member of the informal MINT group of countries and is one of the
        Next Eleven economies.
